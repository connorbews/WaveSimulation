# Introduction

Inspired by the methods pioneered by Horvath[1] and Tessendorf[2], this project explores ocean simulation. Using an oceanographic spectrum, Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) and power of OpenGL and C++, this project delivers authentic wave simulation. 

# Setup Instructions

## Linux

To run this project, you will need to download the latest zipped folder from Releases on GitHub, cd into the folder and run the following command.

```
bash run.sh
```

If you still do not see a window like the one seen in the video above, please run the following commands:
more
```
sudo apt install xorg-dev mesa-utils libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev
```
