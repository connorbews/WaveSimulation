# Introduction

Inspired by the methods pioneered by Horvath[1] and Tessendorf[2], this project explores ocean simulation. Using an oceanographic spectrum, we initiate waves in the spectral domain and efficiently convert them to the spatial domain using the inverse fast Fourier transform.

The simulation enables realistic interactions and evolutions of the waves using a wave propagation model. To bring these dynamic waves to life, we once again employ the inverse fast Fourier transform, smoothly converting the spectral domain information back to the spatial domain.

Through the combined power of OpenGL and C++, this project delivers authentic wave simulation.

# Math

## Wave Initialization

To initialize the wave positions, I used a function known as a Wave Spectrum. This spectrum can be deconstructed into two constituent equations: the non-directional wave spectrum and the directional wave spectrum. By combining the products of these two spectra, I initialized a 256 x 256 grid. This grid exists within the spectral domain; for its conversion into a height field, the transformation utilized of the fftw library alongside a 2D inverse fast Fourier transform.

### Non-directional Wave Spectra

In this project I used the Pierson-Moskowitz Spectrum:

$$S_{pierson moskowitz}(\omega) = \frac{\alpha g^2}{\omega^5}exp(-\beta(\frac{\omega_0}{\omega})^4)$$

### Directional Wave Spectra

In this project I used the Positive Cosine Squared Directional Spreading Spectrum:

$$D_{cos^2}(\theta) = \begin{cases}
    \frac{2}{\pi}cos^2(\theta) & \text{if } \frac{-\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2} \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

## Vertex Normals Calculation

I used the following formula to calculate the slope in the x direction:

$$d_x = \frac{1}{2}[h(i + 1, j) - h(i - 1, j)]$$

I used the following formula to calculate the slope in the y direction:

$$d_y = \frac{1}{2}[h(i, j + 1) - h(i, j - 1)]$$

I can then take the cross product of these vectors is the normal vector. The normal vector normalized results in the following equation:

$$n = \frac{(-d_x, -d_y, 1)}{\sqrt(d_x^2 + d_y^2 + 1)}$$

## Wave Propagation Model

The wave propagation model was defined as:

$$\tilde{h}(k_x, k_y) = \tilde{h}(k_x, k_y) \cdot exp(i\cdot g \sqrt(k_x^2 + k_y^2) \cdot dt)$$

Where $\tilde{h}(k_x, k_y)$ is the 256 x 256 grid in the spectral domain obtained from the oceanographic spectrum

Once again I need to calculate the inverse fast fourier transform in order to convert the spectral domain data into spatial domain data.

I increase the value of "dt", applying the wave propagation model again, and execute the inverse fast Fourier transform once more. This sequence is iteratively executed in a loop, enabling the simulation of the wave's progression over time.
